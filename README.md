This website uses basic html and css, but it was specially developed to practice newly acquired css flexbox skills. Some of the requirements, such as colors were given prior, but other properties such as paddings, I was free to explore. It was also an important assignment to build my understanding of classes. Finally I used this project to get started with the developer tool while I was building it.
